# notes_v1 📝

A Flutter-based productivity app combining a **To-Do list**, **Notes panel**, and a **Daily Journal** into a single, lightweight interface.

This project is my first Flutter application. It started as a simple To-Do app and naturally grew into something more useful, because minimalism is great until you actually want features.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **To-Do List**
  - Create, manage, and track daily tasks
- 🗒️ **Notes Panel**
  - Quick notes for ideas, reminders, or anything that refuses to stay in your head
- 📓 **Daily Journal**
  - A simple space for daily reflections or logs
- 🌗 **Dark / Light Mode**
  - Built-in theme toggle for day and night usage
